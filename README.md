### Background

On August the 3rd 2020, balancer liquidity tokens ([BPT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc81d50c17754b379f1088574cf723be4fb00307d)) [were sent](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbb26dbc1a8da0a136d95276bf6193244ca07075db8fbb8a9d56cfdd90571af90) by mistake to a wrong address.
These tokens are effectively burned. As (in theory) they are required to pull the liquidity back from the pool, the invested WETH and PNK are locked.

However, as ([PNK](https://etherscan.io/token/0x93ed3fbe21207ec2e8f2d3c3de6e058cb73bc04d))'s balances can ultimately be controlled by governance, we can recover the funds.

## The recovery

The idea is to leverage the control over PNK's balances to trick the pool into overestimating the value of PNK over WETH.

We need to first pull some PNK from the pool, then swap some PNK for the WETH we want to recover. Note that:
- the pulled PNK is used to make the token swaps
- everything has to happen in the same transaction to prevent front-running

Only the controller of [PNK](https://etherscan.io/token/0x93ed3fbe21207ec2e8f2d3c3de6e058cb73bc04d) (i.e. [KlerosLiquid](https://etherscan.io/address/0x988b3a538b618c7a603e1c11ab82cd16dbe28069)) can transfer tokens at will. However, it can only execute a single arbitrary transaction at a time. So we need to temporarily replace PNK's controller with this contract to make multiple (internal) transactions at once.

### Steps

1. Deploy `BalancerPoolRecoverer`
1. Transfer PNK's controller rights (in governor)
1. Execute the recovery
    1. Pull all but 2 units of PNK from the pool (need to be PNK's controller)
    1. Swap PNK for WETH 32 times<sup>[1]</sup>
    1. Send the recovered funds to the beneficiary
    1. Restore PNK's controller to KlerosLiquid

<sup>[1]</sup>32 was chosen so that the cost of an additional token swap does not outweight the gains from the swap.<br/>

## Effects

The pool will be drained. Thus the associated liquidity tokens (BPT) will lose almost all of their value.

## Safeguard

If for any reason the recovery cannot be carried out, PNK's controller can still be restored with a 1 hour delay.

## Test

Run the following commands:

```sh
npm install
npm run test
```
